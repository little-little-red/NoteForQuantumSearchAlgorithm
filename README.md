# Quantum Search Algorithms Study Notes

This project contains my study notes, code examples, and related resources on quantum Search algorithms. It covers basic concepts of quantum computing, some quantum search algorithms and their related analysis. Through these notes, I aim to deepen my understanding of quantum computing and provide a reference for other learners.

## Project Structure

- `BooksForMyself/` - Something not related to notes but interesting
- `BooksForNotes/` - Reference for notes
-  `Handbooks/` - Manuals for some related tools (easy for authors to consult)
- `Notes/` - Study notes on quantum algorithms
- `references/` - References and research papers
- `README.md` - Project documentation
  
## Setup

To run the code examples in this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.12+
- qutip

## Main Content

- **Quantum Gate**
- **Universal Gate Set**
- **Quantum Circuit Model**
- **Grover’s Algorithm**
- **Bounds for Grover’s algorithm**
- **Long algorithm**
